      Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the
      Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs
      across its summit point. Its elevation of 8,848.86 m was most recently
      established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.

      Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced
      mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the
      summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the
      other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical
      climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such
      as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from
      avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died
      on Everest,[4] many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.[5]
